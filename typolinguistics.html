					<h3>Typolinguistics</h3>
					<p class="rule">
					<p>The following is the first in a series of brief glossaries relating linguistics and typographic style. This entry focuses on writing systems, text, and differentiating rendered form from abstraction.</p>
					<p class="indent"><span class="entry">TEXT</span>
						Text is a visuotactile recording of linguistic information. There are three methods to creating, or rendering, text: writing is produced by marking a surface once per stroke; lettering is drawn text, in which strokes are built from multiple marks; typography is printed text, produced by a mechanical system, in which multiple strokes are typically produced at once. What you are currently reading is a typographic text printed on your computer screen in my typeface, Talhertz. </p>
					<p class="indent"><span class="entry">LANGUAGE</span>
						Language (uncountable) is a shorthand I will use for the linguistic information that text records. Language lives in the mind &ndash; it has no visuotactile formal qualities of its own. These belong to the <span class="sc">ducti</span> of the Character, hand, typeface, or font in which a text is rendered.</p>
					<p class="indent"><span class="entry">SCRIPT</span>
						A script is a visuotactile system for recording linguistic information. A script is made of <span class="sc">graphs.</span> People use scripts to interpret language as <span class="sc">text.</span> Multiple languages may use the same script, or versions of the same script. For example, Russian and Ukrainian both use versions of the Cyrillic script, while English and Italian use versions of the Latin script.</p>
					<p class="indent-2"><span class="entry">Logographic System</span>
						A script whose graphs represent morphemes, or units of meaning.</p>
					<p class="indent-2"><span class="entry">Syllabary</span>
						A script whose graphs represent syllables or morae (units of speech comprising one or multiple phonemes, but interpreted as a single sound).</p>
					<p class="indent-2"><span class="entry">Abugida</span>
						A script whose graphs represent consonant-vowel pairs.</p>
					<p class="indent-2"><span class="entry">Abjad</span>
						A script whose graphs represent consonantal phonemes, in which vowel content must be inferred through context.</p>
					<p class="indent-2"><span class="entry">Alphabet</span>
						A script whose graphs represent vowel and consonant phonemes.</p>
					<p class="indent-2"><span class="entry">Featural Alphabet</span>
						A script whose graphs represent phonetic features.</p>
					<p class="indent"><span class="entry">STROKE</span>
						A mark formed by a writing implement.</p>
					<p class="indent"><span class="entry">CHARACTER</span>(This word is a little tricky.)</p>
					<p class="indent-2"><span class="entry">uncapitalized</span> also <i>glyph</i>: A  rendered (written, drawn, or printed) unit of linguistic information: an element of a [text]. </p>
						<p class="indent-3"><span class="entry">Letter</span>Also <i>Phonogram:</i> A character that represents a vowel or consonant phoneme: a member of an <span class="sc">alphabet.</span></p>
						<p class="indent-3"><span class="entry">Graph</span>The abstracted, fundamental shape of a <span class="sc">character.</span> That is, the character in your mind&rsquo;s eye, not rendered in text.</p>
					<p class="indent-3"><span class="entry">Grapheme</span>A grapheme is the smallest contrastive unit in a <span class="sc">script,</span> made of one or multiple strokes. A <span class="sc">graph</span> may comprise one or multiple graphemes. For example, &aacute; (aacute) contains the a and the &acute; (acute) graphemes.</p>
					<p class="indent-3"><span class="entry">Ductus</span>(As distinct from <span class="sc">graph</span>) a rendered character&rsquo;s formal qualities.</p>
					<p class="indent-2"><span class="entry">capitalized</span> A commonly recognized visual style in which the characters of a <span class="sc">script</span> are rendered. <i>A brief passage in the italic Character.</i></p>
