<p>Hexcodes are six digit strings used as a shorthand for RGB color.</p>

A hexcode breaks down into three two-digit numbers written in base 16. The first number stands for Red; the second, for Green; the third, for Blue. The higher the number, the more intense the light.</p>

<p>

“Base 16” (10<sub>16</sub>) means that six more numbers are added to each decade. We use the alphabet for these new numbers: </p>

<h3 class="cap">1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F, 10</h3>
<p>

A 'B' in base 16 is as many as our 11 in base 10 (normal counting). An ‘<span class="cap">F</span><sub>16</sub>’ is as large as our 15<sub>10</sub> and 11<sub>16</sub> = 17<sub>10</sub>. The highest a two-digit number can be is “FF<sub>16</sub>,” which equals 255<sub>10</sub>.</p>

If we set all three numbers to FF, we get white.</p>
