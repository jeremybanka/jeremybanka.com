_I crafted italics from a rough sketch in one week. (pushed 270+ glyphs)_

caption="<span style='color: var(--x)'>Regular bolds are reproportioned.</span> <span style='color: var(--z)'>Italic range has been added.</span>"
%}

This is the new Brahmin family. Still deciding if I should give the italic a new 'related identity' in the Ergata system (such as the related identities of [Canticle and Candor](/ergata.html#canticle)), or just treat it as an alternate mode of the Roman (the 4i, 5i, 6i... system I'm using now)

I cut the regular first. I thought, the 'italic' look is about the upstroke, which cuts across rectangular letter interiors diagonally, creating a motif of slanted trangle wedges. Since Brahmin is near-evenly meaty around its skeleton, I subtly weighted the upstroke angle (~46°) as the italic's central axis of contrast, evoking the modern comic hands: the marker, the pencil.

_d p b q n h m u_ • I focused on the placement of the upstroke, its sharp curve where it begins from the left stem, its slow, relaxed transition into the right stem.

_v w y_ • Went as simple as I could think to go for an italic sans. Note the slight leftward flex of the upper stem. Helps with hinting while preserving the angle made with the upstroke.
