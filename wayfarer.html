Wayfarer is a Tabletop role-playing game made of cards.</p>
        <p>
In Wayfarer, your character is your own. Like other tabletop games, your personal character persists between play sessions and progresses alongside the game master's narrative. However, it requires no books or pencil data entry to assemble.</p>
