Wayfarer was originally called DELVE. I chose this name because it was monosyllabic, uncommon, and five letters long, which creates pleasing spacing arrangements. When I learned in 2017 that this name was already in use by a board game with similar gameplay themes, I decided to rebrand.</p>

    Arena, Delve, and Quest are the three types of games you can play with the Wayfarer system.</p>

I decided to keep the DELVE name and 2016 logo design for one of Wayfarer's three &#x2018;Formats.&#x2019; This way, the assets could be used to differentiate  parts of the content structure I developed and show the scope of this project.</p>
