        <h2>a sturdy text glyphic</h2>
        <p class="rule">
        <p>Runa is a expressionistic slab serif with a humanist form structure, moderate contrast, and chiseled, glyphic features. It is designed to hold up well in difficult environments and at diminutive sizes, and to read with a sophisticated yet rugged charm. Runa is unpretentious, hardworking, and real.</p>

        <h2>proportion</h2>
        <p>Runa, like my other text faces, is designed with perfect proportion in mind. The body breaks evenly into twenty-seven units, twelve of which are given to the x-space, eight to the ascender, and seven to descender. The capital takes up eighteen units, giving the ascender two units above.</p>
