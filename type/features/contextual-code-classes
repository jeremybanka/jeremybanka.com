# contextual code documentation
    a class is named after the motifs its members
    interact with and the nature of their interaction.

    motifs:

    EQ = equal      HY - hyphen     GR > greater
    
    TL ~ tilde      BR | bar        LS < less

    the class '@EQAL' holds all (-AL) glyphs that can
    be interact with or contain the equal motif (EQ).

    the class '@INEQ' holds only glyphs with an 
    IN- (initial) EQ (equal motif).

    REFERENCES

.in- "intro" 
    begins a motif. For example "exclam.ineq" is an 
    exclamation point that negates an equality (!=) 

.md- "middle" 
    maintains a motif. For example "slash.mdeq" is 
    a slash (/) that internally negates an equality 
    which underflows it (==/==)

.ut- "out" 
    ends a motif. Such as braceright.uthy (-----})
    
transition
    when a glyph's suffix names two motifs, that glyph
    illustrates a transition between those motifs, in
    that order. For example, "exclam.lshy" is used in
    HTML comment openers <!--, where the exclam (!) 
    sits between a less (< ls) and a hyphen (- hy).
