        <p>Ymirsson is a realist typeface, designed for ideal readability in the worst conditions at the smallest sizes. His glyphs walk in orderly file, clad in moderate contrast and harshly flattened into linear conformity. Uprightly walking and gloomy-browed, these square-built creatures do not find their ideals in geometric truth, but only in the even texture of the emergent whole.</p>

        <p>The rule of the lines is stringently enforced among the Ymirsson fonts. Any sharp or curved glyph that overshoots an alignment boundary is flattened into a short bar. In the case of curved glyphs like s, the exterior is flattened, but the counterform is not. Through the ubiquitous conformity of its subjects, Ymirsson&#x2019;s lowercase appears to form a strip or band along the x-row, making the interval of lines in a paragraph especially distinct.</p>
