            <h2>a rational compromise</h2>
            <p class="rule">
            <p>Willamette &ndash; currently in development &ndash; is a formal text typeface that resists conventional classification. While its architecture is primarily rational (see b, g, n) the borrowing of open apertures and vertical asymmetries from humanist structure help to disrupt a uniform appearance in body settings. The heterodox design extends to the contrast as well. While fairly high and strictly vertical, counters lack the tension and severity of traditional rational designs, such as the Didone or the Baskerville transitional. Thus Willamette mediates a compromise: it keeps the rigid verticality of the rational letter, while shedding some of its formal impracticalities. Its personality is assertive but not pompous.

        <h2>proportion</h2>
        <p>Willamette&rsquo;s proportions are quite bookish and formal: slightly less than half of the body (5/12) is given to the x-space, while the traditionally sized capitals receive exactly two thirds. The ascender holds one eighteenth over the capital height, while the remaining five eighteenths are given below the baseline.</p>
