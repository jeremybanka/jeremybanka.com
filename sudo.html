      Sudo is the ideal modern coding typeface. Its robust, rugged
      cut renders well at the smallest sizes, and its proportions
      are optimized for readability in an editor environment. Sudo
      supports code ligatures of unlimited length both to clarify
      expressions (-->) and create structure (~~~~~~~).

        Sudo is drawn on a monospaced skeleton uniquely adapted to the editor environment.
        Punctuation and symbols are enlarged and in some cases redesigned to disambiguate them and reflect their
        essential role in the code environment.
        Fine details have been scoured from Sudo's robust, chunky alphabet.
        What remains underneath are stoic, square-built letters, irreducible in form.

      <p>
        Sudo supports the entire Mac ⌥ alt and ✒ alt-shift sets.
        Most of these will never be used, but they're all there in case
        you need them.

      <h3>Code Ligatures</h3>
      <p>
        When you enable font ligatures in your editor, logical expressions
        are transformed to express themselves more clearly.
        "<span style="font-feature-settings: 'calt' 0;">--></span>"
        becomes "-->".

      <h2>Design</h2>
    </section>
    <h3>1. |Input| = |Output|</h3>
    <p>
      Before I made Sudo I ran some tests in Visual Studio Code to learn how its text environment applied font
      features.
      The first thing I noticed was how terribly it handled substitutions like ligatures. Unlike a rich text editor, it
      did not put cursor stops inside the ligature glyph to subdivide it, but always placed your cursor after the
      extrawide glyph if you were anywhere within. This made for a terrible user experience: it was a matter of memory
      to ever know where your cursor was placed in a ligature such as ===.
      <figure>
        <img src="/images/sudo-dumb.png" alt="">
      </figure>
    </p>
    <p>The feature would need to be creatively rewritten before it could be shipped.
    </p>
    <p>The standard form of a ligature is,
      <code><em>sub</em> equal equal equal <em>by</em> equal_equal_equal.liga;</code>
      A ligature rule like
      this does take effect in VS Code—the problem is that the software literally replaces three glyphs with one.
    </p>
    <p>This means that the only way to preserve cursor stops is to use a ligature feature with a 1:1 ratio
      between input glyphs and output glyphs. This feature would need to change each compatible glyph individually to a
      contextual form, like a script font does.</p>
    <p>And just like a script font, glyphs would exist in four major varieties for five use cases:</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/images/sudo-forms.png" alt="">
    </figure>
    <p>So I wrote a new series of rules to accomplish the same thing
      while keeping the glyphs separate.
    </p>
    <code>
      <em>sub</em> equal equal' equal <em>by</em> equal.md;<br>
      <em>sub</em> equal' equal <em>by</em> equal.in;<br>
      <em>sub</em> equal equal' <em>by</em> equal.ut;
    </code>
    <p>It is important that the rules are written in this order, because a text editor will change each glyph in the
      reading order only once with the first suitable substitute it finds in the rules. This means
      that rules must be written for the most specific cases (such as the medial case, which has two stipulations)
      listed first, and the more
      general cases (like initial/final) listed last. This is the opposite of CSS-logic, in which you can amend earlier
      statements with later ones. The above font rule-order ensures that a medial glyph becomes medial rather than
      initial
      or final, since it would meet the initial and final criteria as well. Think of it as "filtering out" the specific
      cases before general rules are applied.
    </p>
    <p>Unlike a script font, though, there would need to be several different &ldquo;Motifs&rdquo; for certain
      glyphs, such as > [greater], which has to form different arrows with -> hyphens and equals =>.
    </p>
    <h3>2. Motifs</h3>
