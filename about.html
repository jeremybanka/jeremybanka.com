					<h3 style="text-align:center">MY STORY</h3>
					<p class="rule"></p>
					<p>In my sophomore year of high school, I took an English class that changed my life. In stunning contrast to my previous English teachers, Mr. Hammonds was a grammar stickler. Observing correctly that proper conventions were utterly neglected in our school&#x2019;s curricula, he would give us a grammatical warmup of his own design each day of his class. I quickly discovered that I intuitively used almost every rule Mr. Hammonds described, but had never heard them referred to before.</p>

					<p>An obsession began. For the next year or so, I pored over Wikipedia pages on linguistic typology and ultimately synthesized my own material from what I learned. By my senior year, I had developed an aprioristic constructed language called Srailese with a lexicon of around a thousand English-word equivalents and a slew of bizarre linguistic features&#x2014;for instance, a unified word class that could be dually inflected as verbs or nouns, and a set of five noun genders/classes based on East Asian classical elements.</p>

					<p>It was during my period of work on Srailese that I read my mother&#x2019;s copy of Ellen Lupton&#x2019;s Thinking with Type. I fell in love with Martin Majoor&#x2019;s Scala, in which the volume was set. I based the first typographic alphabet for Srailese on Majoor&#x2019;s digital&#x2013;Baroque masterpiece, and the second on Akzidenz Grotesk.</p>

					</div>
					<p>I discovered that the visual aspects of language gripped me even more strongly than the structural aspects, and during my first year of college, embarked upon typographic design as a personal hobby. With the extracurricular guidance of a typographically knowledgeable professor, I proceeded to design the 2015 Ergata type family, my first set of Roman fonts.</p>

					<p>Since my freshman year, I have continued to design typography, chiefly text faces for my own design work. In 2017, I published <a href="talhertz.html">Talhertz,</a> my first public-release font.</p>
