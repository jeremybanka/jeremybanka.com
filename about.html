    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>
In my sophomore year of high school, I took an English class that inspired me. My teacher, Mr. Jeff Hammonds, was an incisive critic, a storyteller, and truly pedantic grammatician. Realizing that our high school curriculum gave us no formal instruction in technical grammar, he would give us a  warmup of his own design each day of his class. These would demonstrate some convention in English syntax or punctuation. I had read enough at this point to 'feel' all the correct answers, but I couldn't explain why a given answer was correct. It was the first time I'd really thought about the rules of language, and I was amazed at the invisible complexity within the laws of language.</p>
    <p>
Enthralled, I pored over any Wikipedia pages I could find on linguistic typology. I started paying less attention in classes, using what I learned to come up with my own structures and ideas for strange languages. It was an entertaining way to test my own knowledge, and fill the empty hours of school. By my senior year, I had developed an aprioristic constructed language called Srailese with a lexicon of around a thousand English-word equivalents and several totally unique features.</p>
    <p>
It was during my period of work on Srailese that I read my mother&#x2019;s copy of Ellen Lupton&#x2019;s Thinking with Type. The book was good, but its typesetting was amazing. I fell in love with Martin Majoor&#x2019;s Scala, in which the volume was set. I based the first typographic alphabet for Srailese on Majoor&#x2019;s neo-Baroque masterpiece, and the second on Akzidenz Grotesk.</p>

     <p>
I discovered that the visual structures of language gripped me as strongly as the abstract structures, and during my first year of college, embarked upon typographic design as a personal hobby. With the extracurricular guidance of a typographically knowledgeable professor, I proceeded to design the 2015 Ergata type family, my first set of Roman fonts.</p>

    <p>
Since then, I have continued to design typography, chiefly text faces for my own design work. In 2017, I published <a href="/type/talhertz.html">Talhertz</a>, my first public-release font.</p>
