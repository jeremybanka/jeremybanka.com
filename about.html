    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>
      In my sophomore year of high school, I took an English class that inspired
      me. My teacher, Mr. Jeff Hammonds, was an incisive critic, a storyteller,
      and truly pedantic grammatician. Realizing that our high school curriculum
      gave us no formal instruction in technical grammar, he would give us a
      warmup of his own design each day of his class. These would demonstrate
      some convention in English syntax or punctuation. I had read enough at
      this point to 'feel' all the correct answers, but I couldn't explain why a
      given answer was correct. It was the first time I'd thought about the
      invisible complexity of language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enthralled, I pored over any Wikipedia pages I could find on linguistic
      typology. I started paying less attention in classes, using what I learned
      to come up with my own structures and ideas for strange languages. It was
      an entertaining way to test my own knowledge, and fill the empty hours of
      school. By my senior year, I had developed an aprioristic constructed
      language called Srailese with a lexicon of around a thousand English-word
      equivalents and several totally unique features.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was during my period of work on Srailese that I read my mother&#x2019;s
      copy of Ellen Lupton&#x2019;s Thinking with Type, a good book with
      exceptional typesetting. I fell in love with Martin Majoor&#x2019;s Scala,
      in which the volume was set. I based the first typographic alphabet for
      Srailese on Majoor&#x2019;s neo-Baroque masterpiece, and the second on
      Akzidenz Grotesk.
    </p>
    <figure><img src="images/about/srai.png" data-action="zoom" /></figure>
    <p>
      I discovered that the visual structures of language gripped me as strongly
      as the abstract structures, and during my first year of college, embarked
      upon typographic design as a personal hobby. With the extracurricular
      guidance of a typographically knowledgeable professor, I proceeded to
      design the 2015 Ergata type family, my first set of Roman fonts.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
      Since then, I have continued to design typography, chiefly text faces for
      my own design work. In 2017, I published
      <a href="/type/talhertz.html">Talhertz</a>, my first public-release font.
