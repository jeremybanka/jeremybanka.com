        <p>Magescule is a set of square decorative capitals in the style of the greek meander. The set was designed to be placed on Delve cards in two contexts. The first was an isolated context&mdash;an icon signifying a card's denomination. The second context was written in the text of cards referencing these denominations. Here, the capital would be placed at the beginning of the denominating word and clarify the symbol's meaning as an abbreviation.</p>
